  <h1>Fluid Fire Simulation</h1>
  <h2>Henry Allen</h2>
  <h3>CS 184: Computer Graphics and Imaging, Spring 2021</h3>
  <h4>Implementation</h4>
  <p>
    Our fire fluid system was based off of the Navier Stokes fluid simulation. We based our implementation off of the
    <a
      href=https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems3/part-v-physics-simulation/chapter-30-real-time-simulation-and-rendering-3d-fluids>Nvidia
      GPU Gems fluid simulation overview</a>,
    as well as a <a href=https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ldd3WS>simple 2D Navier Stokes</a> implementation we found on
    shadertoy. The simple Navier Stokes variant that we used implemented
    velocity advection, divergence, and pressure shaders in 2D. We extended this implementation to work in THREE.js in
    3D with additional shaders for temperature and reactivity advection.
  </p>
  <p>
    The base implementation for Navier Stokes does three shader passes, the output of each pass becoming the input of
    the next pass, with inputs and outputs being stored as textures. The first pass implements
    velocity, which steps in the negative direction of the velocity at each (x, y) position to get the new velocity at
    each (x, y). This procedure is called advection. We then pass these new velocities as a texture
    to a divergence shader, which estimates the divergence at each (x, y) point by calculating the velocity at the 4
    points above (v_y1), below (v_y0), left (v_x1), and right (v_x0) of the current (x, y), and
    computing div_xy = ((v_x1 - v_x0) + (v_y1 - v_y0)) / 2. We then pass this divergence output and the velocity
    output into a pressure shader, where we compute the Jacobi pressure at each (x, y). This calculation
    gets the sum of pressures at the surrounding blocks above, below, left, and right of each (x, y), and subtracts
    out the divergence at (x, y) and divides by 4. We then display the output velocity at each texture.
    To implement this in THREE.js, we had to use the special GPUComputationRenderer, which allows us to set the render
    targets and dependencies of each shader pass. We then use a ping-pong buffer to display the
    output velocity to alternating materials in the same location. This integration was acutally quite tricky, because
    support for the GPUComputationRenderer is quite poor, and setting the render targets to work with
    the ping pong buffers for each shader is quite tricky.

  <p>
    We next converted this implementation to 3D, where we indexed into a 2D texture as if it were 3D, similar to the
    way one might index into a 1D framebuffer as if it were 2D. We then used ray marching to accumulate
    the velocities along a particular ray, and output the resulting accumulated values. It took a bit of fine-tuning
    to ensure that the fluid simulation displayed with the right amount of color, as it was easy to get
    a blown-out white blob or just a black square. We added our 3D texture onto a cube that we could place anywhere in
    the scene.
  </p>
  <p>
    We then implemented shaders to make the fluid simulation a real fire simulation. This included first changing the
    colors from gray to orange, and then adding a temperature advection shader and a reactivity advection
    shader, The temperature advection makes the fluid sink in the colder air at the top of the cell, and rise near the
    warm source of the fluid. It uses the same advection as the velocity, but accesses into the temperature
    texture, rather than the velocity texture to update the new temperature values. We repeat this process for
    reactivity advection, which just makes the fire decrease in energy as a function of time. This just gets the
    advected reactivity value, and subtracts a uniform constant from it. We also added a slight smoke effect to the
    fire. When reactivity reaches 0, we briefly turn the colorful fire into a gray smoke. We also scale the
    alpha value of the smoke with the z height of the smoke.
  </p>
  <h4>Challenges</h4>
  <p>
    We faced numerous challenges implementing the fluid simulation.
  <ol>
    <li>
      The first challenge was integrating the texture buffer method that was used in the GPU gems and shadertoy
      approach into THREE.js. THREE.js isn't necessarily designed for doing multiple shader passes and
      is especially not designed for passing the output of one shader into another shader as input. We ended up having
      to manually link the outputs of each shader to the inputs of the dependent shaders using
      the alternate render target of the output shader. The normal use case for THREE.js is to just set a dependent
      shader as a dependency with a handy built-in method, but that just seemed to pass in the texture
      before the shader pass, rather than after.
    </li>
    <li>
      We next had trouble implementing the fluid simulation in 3D. The modification to the fluid simulation shaders is
      quite simple, as you just have to add some additional variables to support the additional z-axis.
      The real challenge was working around the poor 3D texture support in THREE.js. There is a 3D texture that you
      can use, but it wasn't possible to use these 3D textures as output targets for our multiple shader
      passes. To circumvent this, we created a larger 2D texture and indexed into it as if it were 3D. We designed
      this 2D texture as if it were a line of 2D textures incrasing along the z-axis.
      To index into it for a 3D point (x, y, z), the x-coordinate would be x + z * (length(x-axis)). This was further
      complicated, as we actual had to round the z value down, and then calculate the two nearest z-planes,
      and interpolate between them.
    </li>
    <li>
      Our final major challenge, which we were unable to solve, was integrating our fluid simulation into the
      particle-based simulation. We originally intended the fluid simulation to be a smoke simulation,
      rather than a fire simulation, but it turned out we weren't able to integrate the smoke in. This occurred
      because the smoke was rendered as the texture of a 3D box, and the particle-based fire was rendered
      inside of this box. Because the texture was displayed on the outside of the box, the particles on the inside
      would be blocked, even if we changed the opacity or alpha-blending of the smoke box. This produced
      some highly unattractive results. This would perhaps be feasible in a more modern graphics engine, where we
      could play around with shaders more, but would have been too challenging in WebGL. A lesson we learned from
      this is to plan out your implementation ahead of time, as we had just assumed that the integration step would
      work. The end result was fine, but we could have very easily ended up with nothing to show for our work.
